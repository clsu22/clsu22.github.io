# Why Now: Data Science → Data Engineering → GenAI → Multi-Agent Systems
My career across Deloitte, CDC, and Roche has shown me how much of drug development and surveillance still relies on fragmented workflows, manual coordination, and human effort just to move data from one step to the next. Even with modern pipelines and dashboards, the real bottleneck has always been orchestration—translating strategy into experiments, experiments into analysis, and analysis into decisions.

When I started experimenting with GenAI and multi-agent systems, I realized they could do more than summarize documents—they could reason, coordinate, and collaborate across tasks the same way humans do. A retriever agent, a validator agent, a reasoning agent, a planning agent, a visualization agent—suddenly the pieces started working together.

This inspired my vision of a Virtual Pharma Enterprise: a globally distributed, continuously improving multi-agent ecosystem that supports strategy definition, experiment design, validation, data quality, and regulatory workflows within real budget and resource constraints. Every success and failure becomes a learning signal, making the system more intelligent over time.

I believe the future of pharma isn’t just automation—it’s an intelligent layer that works alongside us, freeing humans to focus on insight and scientific judgment while agents handle the complexity beneath.
